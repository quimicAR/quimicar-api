A simple API built with Spring Boot in order to provide the elements of the periodic table.
The data provided in this API was downloaded from the following repository [Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON), which has very important data about the elements that I haven't found anywhere else.

# Routes
